# Max to N64
Thease are some Maxscripts to export models from 3DS Max to C code for N64 homebrew development.

There are two scripts - one that exports colored models, and one that exports colored textured models. What's nice about these scripts is that you can select multiple models at once and it will generate all vertex arrays, texture arrays, and graphic display list arrays.

This has only been written and tested on Windows 10 with 3DS Max 2017. If you plan to port it to other operating systems in other languages, please do - just be sure to let me know. I don't know much about licensing, but all permission to port is welcome.
